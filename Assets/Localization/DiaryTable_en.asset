      and there are a lot of homeless people, which is giving me mixed feelings because
      there are also many emigrants leaving for a better life in America ...  just

      delicious. The city has a warm and sunny feel to it and it was a nice change

      help but feel like we've made a terrible mistake. The job I found in the Garment
      District is a nightmare. The conditions are terrible, and the pay is a pittance.
      I'm working myself to the bone, but it's never enough to make ends meet. To
      make matters worse, Mrei now has to work in the same sweatshop as me just to
      help us get by. We live in a tiny apartment in the Lower East Side that's barely
      big enough for the three of us, and we hardly ever leave it. It's no wonder
      that Matti and Mrei have grown distant from me. I feel trapped and alone in

      our home in Luxembourg, and wondering if we should have stayed there after

      that Olive took us in at that time. We have so much to be grateful to her for.
      Thanks to her, I was able to attend Wellesley College. We are both active in
      the Boston women's movement. And Mrei and Matti may also go to college or even
      university someday. None of us would have had these opportunities back in Pfaffenthal.
      It was so right to come here. I feel comfortable in our Boston marriage. And

      and values, but that I truly and wholeheartedly love her.

      I feel that she expects something in return from me that I am not willing to

      little Liesbeth. She often asks about her old home, wants to know all kinds
      of things. And I stand in front of her and realize that I can't tell her anything
      at all. There is an emptiness in her that I cannot fill. Mrei and Matti have
      also been infected by this homesickness. More and more we talk about going
      back to Europe. I would like to stay with the church, because my charitable
      work fills me with great satisfaction. Perhaps a way will be found, may God
      guide our path. Then we could trace Liesbeth's roots. And perhaps also recover
      our own roots. For what is a life worth if it is rootless?

      The best thing is that I can also develop my own photos here. Whenever my time

      opportunities. And there are so many of them in this fantastic city! The other
      day I was even able to sell a series of pictures to a magazine. I hope things
      keep improving, so that someday, in the distant future, I might have my own
      studio. Peter took the advice of a fellow traveler to heart and tried to invest
      our assets profitably. He meets regularly in the evenings at the Waldorf-Astoria

      in search of good photo motifs, I think more and more often how beautiful our
      small, tranquil Pfaffenthal was. Peter, however, had an even worse experience.
      After following the advice of some fellow travelers, he invested our assets

      might not have been a good idea after all. There's no question that we have
      a lot to be grateful to Olive for. Thanks to her, I was able to attend Wellesley
      College, so that I could pursue my long-cherished dream of going to college.
      But accepting Olive's help came at a price. It became clear early on that she
      despised Peter, for whatever reason. She took every opportunity to belittle
      him in front of me. At some point it got so bad we had to break off contact.
      But it didn't stop her. By now Olive has managed to make us look bad to the
      whole of Boston society. We are forced to leave the city because of this snake.
      Peter talks more and more about returning to Luxembourg. And more and more
      often I think, why not?

      they put me in the insane asylum. My hope of getting out after a few days was
      quickly gone. For days and weeks and possibly months I perceived the world
      only through a thick veil, could hardly grasp a meaningful thought, let alone
      speak. Those damn medications! If I had managed not to take them at that time
      as I do now, I'm sure I would have been released soon. I fear now it's too
      late, I'll always be the crazy one. But the worst thing is that nobody tells
      me what happened to Peter. After he initially did everything he could to get
      me out, his visits became less and less frequent and our conversations increasingly
      stiff. I haven't seen him for a long time. Or am I just imagining things? Times

      Julius have become best friends over the years. And since Julius and his wife
      also have children, our two families spend a lot of time together. Of course,
      we notice that the other people in our neighborhood, the old-established aristocracy
      of Philadelphia, don't really accept us, but we don't mind. After all, we have

      We supported him financially so he could set up his own shows. But before things
      took off with his escapology tricks, he practically dumped us. His brother
      took over as his manager, and soon we found ourselves amidst his entourage
      of technicians and assistants without anything to do. So we decided to live
      in Rollingstone, where many other immigrants from Luxembourg had already settled.
      Peter had this crazy idea to draw on his knowledge of winegrowing, so he tried
      to cultivate a local grape variety as a wine grape. The banks of the Rollingstone
      River seemed to offer good conditions for these grapes. But after our first
      harvest, everything fell victim to mildew. All was gone, our vintage, but also
      all our savings. At some point, Peter had to realize that his venture was futile.
      As much as we have tried to make a life for ourselves here, I can''t help but
      think about the possibility of returning to Luxembourg.  '

      person, moody, solitary, and I think he just hates people. But then why did
      he even ask me to help him in his lab in New York? For me, this work meant
      a good source of income. Because you have to hand it to old cranky pants, he's
      extremely generous. And besides, he's on the road most of the time anyway.
      Nevertheless, I don't really feel comfortable here in New York. I miss my old
      home. Maybe when I've saved up enough money, I can afford the fare back to
      Europe. I would love to return to my beautiful Weicherdingen.

    m_Localized: I finally arrived in Detroit and was immediately overwhelmed by
      the beauty of this city! I have heard that it is often referred to as the Paris
      of the West. And I have to say, the noble mansions and beautiful boulevards
      are in no way inferior to the Paris I know from pictures. When it gets dark,
      many streets are even lit up electrically! I was fascinated by all the glowing
      street lamps, it felt like being in a fairy tale.

    m_Localized: I spent almost my entire money on the third class ticket. But I
      actually made it, I'm on the ship! That means I'll be in America in 10 days
      for sure! The conditions on the ship are cramped and the facilities are basic,
      but I am grateful to have a roof over my head, food and a bed to sleep on.
      I heard of the poor conditions on these ships for those traveling in steerage,
      but I am hopeful and determined to make the best of my journey.

    m_Localized: It has been a rough day on the high seas. Many of us are feeling
      seasick and the conditions on the ship are becoming increasingly unpleasant.
      I am doing my best, but it's hard to ignore the lack of hygiene and the cramped
      space. I am longing for the fresh air and open spaces. But worst of all, I
      learned that to enter the United States you have to prove to the authorities
      to have sufficient money! I don't know what to do. I'm as good as broke. Where
      am I going to get all this money?

    m_Localized: 'We were treated to a small concert put on by some of the other
      passengers. It was a welcome distraction from the constant thought running
      through my head: where will I get enough money to enter the country? At least
      for a short while, I was able to forget my worries and hardships. The food
      on the ship is basic and unappetizing, but I am grateful for what I have. I
      spend my days pondering about any idea to get ahold of some money. The sea
      is becoming calmer, but inside me a storm is brewing.'

    m_Localized: Today was a beautiful day on the ship. The sun was shining and the
      sea was calm. I spent some of my time playing games on the deck and making
      friends with the other passengers on the ship. Maybe there is someone who could
      help me out? We also had a small religious service on deck, it was comforting
      and reminded me of home. We are all looking forward to reaching America, but
      the feeling of having left my home headlessly and hastily is getting ever stronger.

    m_Localized: 'It has been another rough day on the high seas. The winds picked
      up and many of us are still feeling seasick. The facilities on the ship are
      becoming increasingly dirty and unsanitary. I am trying to focus on the future
      and what awaits me in America, but it''s hard to ignore my present difficulties.
      And there was a theft on board! The people in the next cabin said that a woman
      in first class had her necklace stolen!  '

    m_Localized: 'Another passenger gave me a small lecture on America and what we
      can expect when we arrive. It was very informative, but I couldn''t help but
      thinking: why didn''t I inform myself better before the trip? We also had a
      small dance in the evening, it was a welcome distraction and gave me a chance
      to socialize with the other passengers. It was a nice reminder of the joys
      of life, even though life seems tough these days.'

    m_Localized: 'It''s only a few days until we reach America! I am feeling a mix
      of emotions, both excitement and fear. We spend the day talking about our hopes
      and dreams for America and what we want to achieve once we arrive. Allthough
      there are still some uncertainties ahead, I decided to look forward to the
      future with a smile in my face. Because that''s what I''m going to do, just
      smile away my problems.

    m_Localized: The sea is rough and many passengers are feeling sick. I am not
      immune either, but thankfully I am able to sleep through most of it. The conditions
      in third class are not the best, but I stay confident. The limited space and
      lack of privacy are a small price to pay for a chance at a better life. That
      is, if I'm going to get this chance at all...

    m_Localized: I met various other people from all over the world who are also
      traveling to start a new life in America. They have been sharing their stories
      and it's been a comfort to know that I am not alone. It's amazing how quickly
      a community forms on this ship, despite the language barriers and different
      backgrounds.

      help but feel grateful for this opportunity and pray that I will safely reach
      America soon.
