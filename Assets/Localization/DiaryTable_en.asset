      the beach and saw people fishing and children playing. The town is quite poor
      and there are a lot of homeless people, which is giving me mixed feelings because
      there are also many emigrants leaving for a better life in America ...  just

      to the poverty we saw elsewhere. I couldn't help but feel a twinge of jealousy

      delicious. The city has a warm and sunny feel to it and it was a nice change

      help but feel like we've made a terrible mistake. The job I found in the Garment
      District is a nightmare. The conditions are terrible, and the pay is a pittance.
      I'm working myself to the bone, but it's never enough to make ends meet. To
      make matters worse, Mrei now has to work in the same sweatshop as me just to
      help us get by. We live in a tiny apartment in the Lower East Side that's barely
      big enough for the three of us, and we hardly ever leave it. It's no wonder
      that Matti and Mrei have grown distant from me. I feel trapped and alone in
      this big, overwhelming city. I find myself thinking more and more often about
      our home in Luxembourg, and wondering if we should have stayed there after
      all.

      small, but it's ours, and we don't have to share it with anyone else. And despite
      the long hours I work, I still find moments to explore the streets of New York
      and take in its energy and vibrancy. It's not the same as Luxembourg, but it's
      a new adventure, and I'm grateful for it.

      The best thing is that I can also develop my own photos here. Whenever my time

      different person. When we started our journey, I was a housemother with no

      that Olive took us in at that time. We have so much to be grateful to her for.
      Thanks to her, I was able to attend Wellesley College. We are both active in
      the Boston women's movement. And Mrei and Matti may also go to college or even
      university someday. None of us would have had these opportunities back in Pfaffenthal.
      It was so right to come here. I feel comfortable in our Boston marriage. And
      only gradually do I realize that Olive and I not only share the same opinions
      and values, but that I truly and wholeheartedly love her.

      I feel that she expects something in return from me that I am not willing to

      Savior. And often I ask myself if it was the right decision to take care of
      little Liesbeth. She often asks about her old home, wants to know all kinds
      of things. And I stand in front of her and realize that I can't tell her anything
      at all. There is an emptiness in her that I cannot fill. Mrei and Matti have
      also been infected by this homesickness. More and more we talk about going
      back to Europe. I would like to stay with the church, because my charitable
      work fills me with great satisfaction. Perhaps a way will be found, may God
      guide our path. Then we could trace Liesbeth's roots. And perhaps also recover
      our own roots. For what is a life worth if it is rootless?

      When Mrei performs daredevil tricks on her horse, I really get scared. But
      she loves it. And Matti sacrificially takes care of the horses when they're
      not performing. Bill was right, we are like one big family. Someday, he says,

      again. But our real home is the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show.

      When I was asked if I would like to manage the Buffalo Bill Museum in the newly
      founded town of Cody, I didn't hesitate for long. Since then, our lives have
      become calmer. The children are finally able to attend a decent school and
      have settled in well here in the wilds of Wyoming. Every now and then Bill
      or other people from the show stop by to say hello, and each time I think I
      made the right decision to settle down here.

      about how he could earn money. At some point, he came up with the absurd idea
      of traveling to the Klondyke area to look for gold. I haven't heard from him

      necessary. Metti isn't home most of the time either, I hardly ever get to see

      consumed by just one feeling - hatred...
