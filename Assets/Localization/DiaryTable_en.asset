    m_Localized: Today we are saying goodbye to our hometown Pfaffenthal. I couldn't
      help but feel a mix of emotions as we left. I grew up here, and it's where
      my children were born, but it's also where we've struggled so much. Matti and
      Mreis were both excited to leave, especially Matti with his love of trains.
      We are packing what little we have and will soon set off for Luxembourg City.

    m_Localized: We should make it <b>to Ellis Island until the 10th of September</b>.
      Uncle Jhoss is picking us up at Ellis Island, because us women are not allowed
      to immigrate to the US without a man taking the responsibilty. If we don't
      make it until this date, we might get rejected at the border, so being late
      isn't really being an option here. We should start to pack our stuff and get
      going.
