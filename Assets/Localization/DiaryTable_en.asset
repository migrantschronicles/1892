      help but feel a mix of emotions as we left. I grew up here, and it''s where
      my children were born, but it''s also where we''ve struggled so much. Matti
      and Mreis were both excited to leave, especially Matti with his love of trains.
      We are packing what little we have and will soon set off for Luxembourg City.

      We
      should make it <b>to Ellis Island until the 10th of September</b>. Uncle Jhoss
      is picking us up at Ellis Island, because us women are not allowed to immigrate
      to the US without a man taking the responsibilty. If we don''t make it until
      this date, we might get rejected at the border, so being late isn''t really
      being an option here. We should start to pack our stuff and get going.'

    m_Localized: It's been a few years since we first arrived in Minneapolis with
      nothing but our hopes and dreams. Looking back on our journey, I feel grateful
      for the second chance to create a life we can be proud of. But it wasn't until
      I met Michel, another Luxembourgish migrant, that everything fell into place.
      Matti and Mrei are now attending school here, and we welcomed another little
      one into our family.

      being here in Minneapolis. From the moment we arrived, I felt a pull towards
      this city, and I'm glad that our journey brought us here. \r\n\r\nIt's amazing
      to see how far we've come, and I am excited to see what the future holds for

      made a mistake in leaving Luxembourg. Sometimes I wonder if we will ever truly
      fit in here. Life is difficult and we are struggling to make ends meet. I miss
      the comfort of our old home and the familiarity of our old routines. Even Michel's
      company doesn't bring me the same joy it used to.

      I have become the parish's sextant and am respected in the community, I can't
      shake the feeling that I don't truly belong here. I have never remarried and
      sometimes I wonder if I have missed out on the opportunity for love and companionship.
