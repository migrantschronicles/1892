      nothing but our hopes and dreams. Looking back on our journey, I feel grateful
      for the second chance to create a life we can be proud of. But it wasn't until
      I met Michel, another Luxembourgish migrant, that everything fell into place.
      Matti and Mrei are now attending school here, and we welcomed another little
      one into our family.

    m_Localized: There are a lot of German living here, which makes it almost feel
      like home. Matti is fascinated by the ships that are docked in the harbor,
      and he has been asking endless questions about them. Mreis has been enjoying
      the parks and gardens here and I know she will miss them when we move on.

    m_Localized: This small village is full of friendly people and picturesque farms.
      We were welcomed with open arms and I feel like we have finally found a true
      sense of community. Mreis has been learning about the different crops that
      they grow here and she has a new appreciation for the hard work that goes into
      farming. Matti has been playing with the local children. I guess we will all
      remember this place with fondness.

    m_Localized: Arriving in Minneapolis was like a breath of fresh air. The city
      is surrounded by lush green forests and big lakes and ponds.The locals are
      friendly and welcoming, and we quickly found a place to rest our weary heads.
      The children were particularly excited to see the steamboats on the Mississippi
      River and couldn't stop talking about them

    m_Localized: 'This little village is surrounded by rolling hills and farmlands.
      The people here are warm and hospitable, and I am so happy to see how well-connected
      the community is. My children were fascinated by the abundance of livestock
      roaming freely in the fields, particularly cows and pigs. It is small and peaceful
      here, providing a much-needed respite from the hustle and bustle of city life. '

    m_Localized: This city is much different from the others we've been to. It has
      a much more rural feel. We were welcomed by fields of corn and wheat and a
      beautiful rolling landscape. The city itself is small, with wooden buildings
      and dirt roads, but everyone here has been very friendly. I was told that Dubuque
      city with a thriving business and industrial sector, and it was once a center
      of the lead mining industry. I am thrilled to see what lies ahead of us.

    m_Localized: The town is small, but it has a tight  - knit community of German
      immigrants, almost like us. The air is filled with the scent of freshly baked
      bread from the local bakery, and the sound of chickens in the nearby farms.
      Matti is thrilled to see all the animals, and Mreis ejoys the blue skies and
      the sunrays;

    m_Localized: We arrived in the bustling city of Philadelphia. I had heard so
      much about this city and I was eager to explore it. The streets were crowded
      with horse-drawn carriages and people rushing about their business. I was surprised
      to find out that many of the residents here spoke German, which made me feel
      more at home.

    m_Localized: "Today we are saying goodbye to our hometown Pfaffenthal. I couldn't
      help but feel a mix of emotions as we left. I grew up here, and it's where
      my children were born, but it's also where we've struggled so much. Matti and
      Mreis were both excited to leave, especially Matti with his love of trains.
      We are packing what little we have and will soon set off for Luxembourg City.
      \n\nWe should make it to Ellis Island until the 10th of September. Uncle Jhoss
      is picking us up at Ellis Island, because us women are not allowed to immigrate
      to the US without a man taking the responsibilty. If we don't make it until
      this date, we might get rejected at the border, so being late isn't really
      being an option here. We should start to pack our stuff and get going."
