    m_Localized: 'Dear Diary,

      What a horrible incident. Yesterday has been
      really rough. Although it started so well. <b>Pir and</b> I went to the big
      shop at the <b>City Center</b> and sold all of the things that we won''t need
      for our big journey. And now? I would leave all the money and everything behind,
      just so he could come with us. I can''t believe he is not here anymore. <b>That
      horrible fire.</b> What a horrible incident. I need to get away from this place
      and I need to stay strong for <b>Matti and Mreis</b>. My heart is broken. I
      hope we can start anew.'
